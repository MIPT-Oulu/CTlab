X-Ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients

The data includes the mass attenuation coefficients of iodine, water, bone and air for different energies of X-ray radiation. 
X-ray Attenuation information is used in the calculation of CT projections during the simulation see more [calculateProjections](../Functions/calculateProjections.m) . 
Mass attenuation coefficients can be downloaded from https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients
