X-Ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients

The data includes the mass attenuation coefficients of iodine, water, bone and air for different energies of X-ray radiation. 
X-ray Attenuation information is used in the calculation of CT projections during the simulation see more [Functions/calculateProjections.m](https://github.com/MIPTOulu/CTlab/blob/main/CTlab%20v1.4/Functions/calculateProjections.m) .
